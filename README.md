# LAFF Linear Algebra

 <p>This Repository contains all my programming Assignments for the Linear Algebra LAFF MOOC.</p>
 
 <p>The programming assignments were made using MATLAB. All of the alogrithms are made based on the FLAME code notation which slices and dices a matrix before performing a certain operation on it.</p>
